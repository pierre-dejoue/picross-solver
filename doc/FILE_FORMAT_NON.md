NON File Format
===============

## File Format

The NON file format for nonogram puzzles was originally developped by Steve Simpson.


It has been extended to support colored nonograms.

Here are two resources that describe the format:
 - Orignal version: [Puzzle-file format](https://scc-forge.lancaster.ac.uk/open/nonogram/fmt2)
 - Extended version: [NON File Format](https://github.com/mikix/nonogram-db/blob/master/FORMAT.md)

## Caveats

It is not clear in both descriptions if a blank line should be represented by an empty line or a line
with a zero. The Picross solver supports both representations.
