		    SAMPLE PAINT-BY-NUMBER PUZZLE SET
		     Version 8 - September 23, 2013
                                Jan Wolter

This archive contains descriptions of the sample paint-by-number / nonogram
puzzles used as a test set in my "Survey of Paint-by-Number Puzzle Solvers"
which can be found at http://webpbn.com/survey/

Versions of this archive are available in many different formats from

	http://webpbn.com/survey/puzzles/

The format used in this archive is described in the README-FORMAT file
included here.

Puzzles with names of the format "webpbn-DDDDD" can also be obtained from the
webpbn export page at http://webpbn.com/export.cgi , but there is a chance
that puzzles on webpbn could be alterned by their designers, so this archive
is the prefered source for the test set.

Archives for file formats that support color puzzles will include not only
the black and white puzzle sample set, but the multicolor sample set as
well.  The multicolor puzzles have file names starting 'webpbn-color-'.

Most puzzles are drawn from the webpbn.com puzzle site, which is an on-line
community where users create, share, and solve paint-by-number puzzles.  It
is the policy of that site that, by default, the copyright for all puzzles
is retained by the designer of that puzzle, and that though puzzles posted
there may be downloaded from that site for personal use, they may not be
redistributed freely.

Some, but not all, of the authors of puzzle included in this sample set have
given explicit permission for these puzzles to be freely redistributed,  These
puzzles may be treated as if they are under something like a Creative Commons
attribution license - so they can be reused and distributed freely as long as
the attribution of the puzzles is retained.

These puzzles in this archive are not by any means 'typical' puzzles.  They
represent a spectrum of difficulty, ranging from very easy to extremely
difficult.  Many have multiple solutions.  Many puzzles have been included
in the set specifically because they cause problems for specific solvers.
