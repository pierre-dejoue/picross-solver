Picross Solver
==============

Picross is a puzzle game licensed by Nintendo. Those puzzles are also called nonograms or
paint-by-number. The goal is to find a hidden picture in a rectangular grid, by painting
some of the cells with one color, or leaving them blank. The information given is, for
each row and each column, the number and sizes of the grousp of continuous filled cells
on that line.

This is a solver library for Picross puzzles. The solver will find the solutions of a grid
based on the row and column constraints given as input. The solver handles grids with
multiple solutions and can be used as a validator to the check uniqueness of the
solution.

## Features

 - Solver library with no dependency other than C++14
 - Black and white puzzles only
 - Two file formats are supported:
   - A native format created for the library
   - Steve Simpson's [NON format](doc/FILE_FORMAT_NON.md)

## Library

The Picross solver provided as a library

### Dependencies

C++14

### Build

With [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). For example on Windows:

```
mkdir -p build/msvc141x64
cd build/msvc141x64
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ../..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Install

Install in some dir:

```
cmake --install . --config Release --prefix <some_dir>
```

Or, package the library:

```
cpack -G ZIP -C Release
```

## Test Applications

A CLI and a GUI applications built on top of the solver library

### Dependencies

Graphical UI:

* OpenGL
* [GLFW3](http://glfw.sf.net)
* [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [Portable File Dialogs](https://github.com/samhocevar/portable-file-dialogs)

Command line interface:

* [Argagg](https://github.com/vietjtnguyen/argagg)

### Build

On Windows:

```
mkdir -p build/msvc141x64
cd build/msvc141x64
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DPICROSS_BUILD_APP=ON -DPICROSS_BUILD_CLI=ON ../..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Command Line Tool Usage

Run the CLI on the example file:

```
./build/msvc141x64/bin/Release/picross_solver_cli.exe inputs/example_input.txt
```

Use the validation mode to test multiple files at once and check the uniqueness of the solution:
 - Output one line per puzzle
 - Status is `OK` if the puzzle is valid and has a unique solution
 - Difficulty hint: `LINE` for puzzles that are line solvable
 - Performance timing

```
./build/msvc141x64/bin/Release/picross_solver_cli.exe --validation inputs/PicrossDS/Normal/*
```

### Screenshots of the Graphical Interface

The GUI shows an animation of the solving process, and finally the solution(s). Here are two examples
from the game Picross DS:

The hardest puzzles are not line solvable, meaning they cannot be solved simply by using the usual
method of iterating on individual rows and columns. When no further progress can be made, the algorithm
has to test different alternatives in order to reach a solution. That backtracking mechanism
is shown with tiles of varying colors:
